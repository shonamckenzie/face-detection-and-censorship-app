# Face detection and censorship app

This app is written in Javascript utilising canvas, FaceDetector API, and parcel bundler.  
The app takes in the stream from a users webcam, the FaceDetector api detects any faces within the stream and a pixelated box is then placed over the detected faces.

FaceDetector api is currently in beta - to enable on chrome you need to enable Experimental Web Platform features under chrome://flags
